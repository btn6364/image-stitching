# Project Title

Image Stitching from scratch using OpenCV. 

## Description

An implementation of the famous image stitching technique from scratch using OpenCV. 
Image stitching involves 4 crucial steps: 
1. Detect key points and descriptors. Then match them accordingly. 
2. Compute the homography matrix for image transformation. 
3. Warp image (Project one image to another image's plane using the homography matrix). 
4. Blend the warped images together. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
First, you need to install all the required dependencies using ```pip``` command. 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program
